# EXPLANATION OF PLAYBOOK
# ---                                         -> Marks the start of a YAML document.
#
# - name: print facts                         -> Names this play "print facts" for easier identification in logs/output.
# hosts: all                                  -> Tells Ansible to run this play on all hosts listed in the inventory file.
# gather_facts: true                          -> Instructs Ansible to automatically collect system information (called “facts”)
#                                                from each host before running any tasks (e.g. OS, IP, CPU, memory, etc.).
#
# tasks:                                      -> Defines the list of actions (tasks) Ansible will perform on each host.
#   - name: print facts                       -> Names this specific task "print facts" so it appears clearly in the output.
#     ansible.builtin.debug:                  -> Uses Ansible’s built-in “debug” module to display information to the console.
#       var: ansible_facts                    -> Specifies which variable to print — in this case, "ansible_facts",
#                                                which contains all the gathered system facts about the host.
